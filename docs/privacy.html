1.  Information We Collect NetPay is designed to operate primarily
    offline.

We do NOT collect: - Social Security numbers - Bank account

Any paycheck inputs entered into the App are stored locally on your

2.  In-App Purchases Purchases are processed securely by Apple App Store
    or Google Play Store. We do not collect or store payment
    information.

3.  Analytics If analytics services are added in the future, they will
    collect anonymous usage data only. No personally identifiable
    financial data is collected.

4.  Data Storage Saved paycheck data is stored locally on your device.
    Deleting the App may remove stored data. We are not responsible for
    data loss caused by device resets or deletions.

5.  Children’s Privacy NetPay is not intended for children under 13. We
    do not knowingly collect personal information from children.
